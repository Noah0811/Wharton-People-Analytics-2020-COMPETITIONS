Explore patterns in staff mobility in the two UN agencies and use the data to provide insights to the following questions: 1.Does mobility have a positive impact on an individualâ€™s career advancement? /n
2.Are there differences between genders and other demographic factors? UNICEF has re-introduced a managed mobility system whereas UNDP currently does not have a managed system; is one system more beneficial than the other?
